Where to find the course / Scholarship details?
	- Before any of this began, I first noticed that Microsoft Azure is giving away 300 scholarships for the ML Nanodegree program on a random news portal. But then I couldn't trace out where the course was being provided.
	- And then I googled the same and found out, the course was being offered on Udacity.
	- Moral: Subscribe yourself to news portals. Keep looking up the sites where you can find courses/content that interests you regularly.
