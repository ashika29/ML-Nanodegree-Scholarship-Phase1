# ML Nanodegree Scholarship Phase1
 Udacity and Microsoft Azure ML Nanodegree Scholarship Phase-1 resources (Jul 2020 - Sep 2020)

I was one among the top 300 applicants that were selected for the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree Scholarship for Foundations course, a.k.a Phase-1.
We've been provided a lot of useful resources and I've personally learnt a whole lot ranging from small technical definitions to handling Azure ML studio really well. I thought of making some notes as resources are always helpful to everyone at some point or the other. This will also mark my knowledge permanently on a cloud server.

So this repository is all about the course related resources/notes created by me upon learning & completing this course!

Happy learning!
